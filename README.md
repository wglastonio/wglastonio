- 👋 Hi, I’m @wglastonio
- 👀 I’m interested in develop my knowledge in both, front end and back end programming languages. I am also interested in develop data analysis knowledges.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some programming languages as http, css, javascript, java, python. Also, looking for learning concepts and basic usage for some databases as PostgresSQL, MongoDB and other NoSQL databases.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on what I could really help.
- 📫 How to reach me out? Just send me a message :)
